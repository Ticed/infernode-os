# scene.m — a 2-D scene: model, record grammar, camera, renderer.
#
# A scene is things in a plane (or on the globe) over time: entities
# that move, features that are drawn, background layers, a clock.  It
# is served as a directory of ndb stanza files (docs/scene-design.md
# §2) and changed by one-line records (§3.2).  This library is the
# whole of the scene's semantics; scenefs, scene-view and scenerender
# are thin clients of it.
#
# Positions are always (a, b) in the order the frame writes them:
# (lat, lon) in the geo frame, (x, y) in the xy frame.  Pixels never
# appear in the model — the camera owns them.
#
